## Step 8: Produce report
I need a report for people to play with

- Use `shiny` to produce interactive online reports
- Can host locally (for other R users)
- Can use a server (for internal users, uses Linux)
- Can use a hosting platform like [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library("shiny")

#Run the shiny app (app.R) in the current folder
runApp(".")
```
